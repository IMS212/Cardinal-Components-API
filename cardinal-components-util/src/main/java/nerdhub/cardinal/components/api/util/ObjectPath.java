/**
 * Represents a function that extracts a property from a given object.
 *
 * <p> Such functions may be chained to represent the traversal of a full object path.
 * Object paths formed in this way will short-circuit at any point
 * a <code>null</code> reference is encountered.
 *
 * <p> Object paths are similar to {@link Optional Optionals} in that they offer
 * the ability to turn a sequence of operations into a succinct pipeline
 * that abstracts away <code>null</code> handling.
 * However, while an {@code Optional} is an immutable container object wrapping the
 * actual value, an {@code ObjectPath} only describes the computational
 * operations that will be performed on a source object.
 * Because object paths do not need to create new container objects at each step of
 * the computation, they are likely (though not guaranteed) to be faster than their
 * {@code Optional} counterparts. For further performance gains as well as code
 * compacting, it is recommended to cache and reuse {@code ObjectPath} instances.
 *
 * <p> As {@code ObjectPath} should be reusable on multiple sources, even concurrently,
 * its operations should be stateless.
